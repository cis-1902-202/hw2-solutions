# Implement the test cases for the `BaseCSV` class and the `CSVEditor` class.
# Note that it is TOTALLY ok to create temporary files, just make sure to clean
# them up after. (You can use the `os` module for this.)
# NOTE: we are not looking for super rigorous testing here, just one test case
# per method is fine. (feel free to add more if you want)
